King's Gizmondo Genesis Emulator Generator
==========================================================================================

How to Install:
---------------

- Simply run the setup file, and install the package.
- I recommend you run the .msi file, instead of the .exe file.
- Note that this program requires the .NET Framework to install. Setup should install it for you, if you haven't already. To install it manually, you can obtain it from either of the following links:

The .NET Framework v1.1:

How to Generate Games:
-----------------------

- If you're converting just one ROM:

-- Make sure the "File" Radio button is selected.
-- Select your ROM by using the "Load ROM..." Feature. Note that it must a 512Kb ROM file. This version now supports .smd files, as well as .bin files.
-- Type in a name for your ROM to be saved as (Output File Name).
-- Select your output directory
-- Hit the generate button

- If you're converting more than one ROM:

-- Make sure the "Directory" Radio button is selected.
-- Select the directory containing the ROMs using the "Load Dir..." Feature.
-- Select your output directory
-- Hit the generate button

- (If your Generating alot of ROMs --> EXE , it might take a while...please be patient)

Advanced Options:
-----------------

The T1 byte size is the first part of the Template Emulator. The ROM byte size is the size of your ROM (Has to be 512Kbs anyway). The T2 byte size is the final part of the Template Genesis Emulator.

WARNING: It is not recommended you alter the advanced options.
