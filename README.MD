Gizmondo Homebrew Pack

Thanks to Critical Hippo, Reesy, sweetlilmre, and Notaz for their support and help in gathering Gizmondo binaries.
Special thanks goes to sweetlilmre who helped me fix issues with running Grodo on my Gizmondo.

*** READ HERE ***
Please use Firefly's Launcher. Firefly's Launcher allows you to play all the emulators without having to run WindowsCE mode.
Simply place the autorun from the Firefly folder onto the root of your SD card.
A few emulators such as SquidgEngine will not work with Firefly's launcher. A way around this is to rename them to
SquidgEngine.exe and place them on the root of the SD card alongside a generic autorun file. In this case, make sure to rename
Firefly's Launcher to something other than autorun.

Updating Your Gizmondo to Service Pack B:
1. Place autorun.exe and install.bin onto the root
of your SD card
2. Run autorun.exe from the Games Directory

Entering Windows CE on your Gizmondo
1. Place files from LockNLoad folder onto the root of your SD card (leave WinCE as a folder)
2. run autorun.exe in Games Directory
