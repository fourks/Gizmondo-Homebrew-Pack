Copy "autorun.exe" and "multiboot.hog" to the ROOT of your SD card.

Games can be in any folder on the root of the SD, as long as the main executable is named "autorun.exe". WMV videos can be in any folder on the root of the SD card as well.

The launcher will ONLY see folders with either a .wmv file or a "autorun.exe" file inside of them.

Example (For Trailblazer):

SD ROOT: (names in brackets specify folders)

[GZGA200012] (Game data...launcher will not list this folder due to no "autorun.exe" inside)
[Trailblazer] (Put Trailblazer executable in here, renamed to "autorun.exe". Launcher reads foldername)
autorun.exe (this is the launcher)
multiboot.hog (required launcher file)


Example For WMV files:

[Faceoff] (movie.wmv video inside)

With this configuration, you will see "Faceoff" listed on the menu, and when selected will play the video.


There may be more possibilities, test!

Enjoy!
