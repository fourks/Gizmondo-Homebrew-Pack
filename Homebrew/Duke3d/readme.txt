Download Duke Nukem 3D "3dduke13.zip - v1.3d Shareware Episode (5785k) "

Tech Info:
--------------------------------------------------

Sound is a bit choppy, Might be too fast for some, sometimes quits out (happen once so far).
To slow the game down, edit the "Duke3D.cfg" file and change "Platform_Timer_HZ = 210" to a lower number, E.G. "Platform_Timer_HZ = 180".

Allmost forgot, added 3 save game files, so you can overwright them with your progress, as you cannot save on a blank save spot cos you cannot type a name for it.
