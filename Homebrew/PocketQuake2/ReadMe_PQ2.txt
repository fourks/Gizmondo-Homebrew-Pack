=Legal======
  Use this software at your own risk.  It is totally unsupported, either by Dan East, or id Software.  Neither Dan East nor id Software will be held resposible for any damages to your device, or any files residing on your device, that may be caused by your running Pocket Quake 2.

=Hardware Requirements=======
  Only Strong ARM and MIPS devices running Pocket PC or Pocket PC 2002 with RGB 565 color encoding are supported.  You need at 20+ MB free Program Memory to run Pocket Quake 2.

=Installation Instructions======
  Run the installer on your PC.  The installer will install Pocket Quake2 on your device.  You may specify to install either directly on the device, or to the storage card.
  YOU MUST DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE GAME DATA FILES, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED SEPARATELY!  The Game Data File (PAK0.PAK) must be unzipped, and copied onto your Pocket PC.  They must be placed in:

\Storage Card\Quake2\baseq2\pak0.pak

OR if you have a 64 MB Pocket PC with enough free space:
\Quake2\baseq2\pak0.pak

IF YOU GET THE ERROR "Couldn't load pics/colormap.pcx" then the pak0.pak file is in the wrong place or is corrupt / truncated.  Make sure you have put it in the exact directory as specified above (NOT IN "MY DOCUMENTS"!), and make sure you have unzipped it.  The File Explorer on your PC is set by default to "Hide file extensions for known types".  Thus the file may really be zipped (pak0.pak.zip), but the zip extension is hidden from you (pak0.pak).  The default file explorer that is built into your Pocket PC will always hide file extensions from you.  Use DEXplor (shareware, http://dex-plor.com) for advanced file management, zipping, shortcut management, etc.

=Known Issues=======
  There is no sound support.

  It is slow.
